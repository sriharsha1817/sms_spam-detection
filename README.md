# SMS Spam Detection

## Overview
SMS Spam Detection is a machine learning model that takes an SMS as input and predicts whether the message is a spam or not spam message. The model is built using Python and deployed on the web using Streamlit.

## Technology Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Streamlit

## Features
- Data collection
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Model building and selection
- Web deployment using Streamlit

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
The data was cleaned by handling null and duplicate values, and the "type" column was label-encoded. The data was then preprocessed by converting the text into tokens, removing special characters, stop words and punctuation, and stemming the data. The data was also converted to lowercase before preprocessing.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis was performed to gain insights into the dataset. The count of characters, words, and sentences was calculated for each message. The correlation between variables was also calculated, and visualizations were created using pyplots, bar charts, pie charts, 5 number summaries, and heatmaps. Word clouds were also created for spam and non-spam messages, and the most frequent words in spam texts were visualized.

### Model Building and Selection
Multiple classifier models were tried, including NaiveBayes, random forest, KNN, decision tree, logistic regression, ExtraTreesClassifier, and SVC. The best classifier was chosen based on precision, with a precision of 100% achieved.
